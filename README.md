# 🧮 AI Calculator

## 📝 Overview
The **AI Calculator** is an innovative project that utilizes OpenCV and Google’s Gemini AI to solve mathematical problems. Users can draw mathematical expressions directly on the screen, and the AI model will interpret the input to provide accurate and detailed solutions. This project uses advanced AI and computer vision technologies to enhance user interaction and calculation accuracy.

## ✨ Features
- **Draw Math Problems** ✍️: Draw mathematical expressions directly on the screen.
- **Move Pointer** 🖱️: Use two fingers to move the pointer around the screen.
- **Reset Canvas** 🗑️: Lift the thumb to erase the current drawing.
- **Send to AI Model** 📤: Send the drawing to the AI model by lifting the little finger.
- **Detailed Solutions** 📊: The AI model interprets the drawing and provides a step-by-step solution.
